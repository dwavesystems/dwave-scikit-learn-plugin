# D-Wave `scikit-learn` Plugin

This package provides a `scikit-learn` transformer for 
[feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection) using a quantum-classical hybrid solver. 

For an introduction to hybrid methods for feature selection, see the [Feature Selection example](https://github.com/dwave-examples/feature-selection-notebook) Jupyter Notebook.

The package's main class, `sklearn.feature_selection.SelectorMixin`, can be used in any existing `sklearn` pipeline.

## Examples

A minimal example of using the hybrid feature selection: 

```python
from dwave.plugins.sklearn.transformers import SelectFromQuadraticModel
import numpy as np

# generate uniformly random data, 10,000 observations and 300 features 
data = np.random.uniform(-10,10, size = (10000,300))

outcome =  np.array([int(i) for i in (np.random.uniform(0,1, size = (10000,1)) > .5)])

# instantiate the feature selection class
selector = SelectFromQuadraticModel()

# solve the feature-selection problem 
data_transformed = selector.fit_transform(data, outcome)
```

For large problems, the default runtime may be insufficient. You can use the CQM solvers's 
[`min_time_limit`](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_system/reference/generated/dwave.system.samplers.LeapHybridCQMSampler.min_time_limit.html)
method to find the minimum accepted runtime for your problem; alternatively, simply submit as above 
and check the returned error message for the required runtime. 

The feature selector can be re-instantiated with a longer time limit.

```python
# instantiate the feature selection class with a longer time limit 
selector = SelectFromQuadraticModel(time_limit = 200) 
```
