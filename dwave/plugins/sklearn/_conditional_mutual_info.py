    """
    For the feature array `X` and the target array `y` computes
    the matrix of (conditional) mutual information interactions.
    The matrix is defined as follows:

    `M_(i, i) = I(x_i; y)`

    If `conditional = True`, then the off-diagonal terms are computed:

    `M_(i, j) = (I(x_i; y| x_j) + I(x_j; y| x_i)) / 2`

    Otherwise

    `M_(i, j) = I(x_i; x_j)`

    Computation of I(x; y) uses modified scikit-learn methods.
    The computation of I(x; y| z) is based on
    https://github.com/jannisteunissen/mutual_information and [3]_.

    The method can be computationally expensive for a large number of features (> 1000) and
    a large number of samples (> 100000). In this case, it can be advisable to downsample the
    dataset.

    The estimation methods are linear in the number of outcomes (labels) of discrete distributions.
    It may be beneficial to treat the discrete distrubitions with a large number of labels as
    continuous distributions.

    Args:
        X: See :func:`sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`

        y: See :func:`sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`

        conditional: bool, default=True

            information or joint mutual information

        discrete_features: See :func:`sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`

        discrete_target: bool, default=False
            Whether the target variable `y` is discrete

        n_neighbors: See :func:`sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`

        random_state: See :func:`sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression`

        n_jobs: int, default=None
            The number of parallel jobs to run for the conditional mutual information
            computation. The parallelization is over the columns of `X`.
            ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
            ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
            for more details.

    Returns:
        mi_matrix : ndarray, shape (n_features, n_features)
        Interaction matrix between the features using (conditional) mutual information.
        A negative value will be replaced by 0.
